This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala: encountering a `NullPointerException` when passing `null` to a method that expects an `Int` parameter. The `bug.scala` file contains the code that reproduces this error. The `bugSolution.scala` file offers a solution by explicitly handling null values using pattern matching or optional types (Option).  Understanding this issue is important to prevent unexpected crashes in Scala applications.
